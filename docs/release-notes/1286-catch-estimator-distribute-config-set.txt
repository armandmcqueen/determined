**Improvements**

- Prevent users from setting the DistributeConfig for an Estimator

  - If an Estimator has been configured to do distributed training via a tf.distribute.Strategy,
    that can conflict with how Determined does distributed training, leading to errors (mostly
    crashes and OOMs). With this change, Determined will try to catch this problem to give
    the user an informative error message. An Estimator can still be configured with an empty
    DistributeConfig, as this does not cause TF to try to do distributed training.
