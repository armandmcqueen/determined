**Improvements**

-  Improve metric selector in Trial detail page.

   -  Users can now select all metrics, select all results that match
      the filter, and reset selected metrics back to the defaults.
      Selecting an option while filtering will no longer close the
      selector and clear the filter. Also made the text shown when
      dropdown is closed more informative.
